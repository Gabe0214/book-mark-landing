# Book Mark Landing Page

This is a responsive book mark landing page that was made with HTML, SASS(scss), and Javascript.


I also used Gulp for task management, which made the development enviornment so much better. 

This project was a challenge created by : "https://frontendmentor.io". They have a ton of other projects, in which web developers can replicate it in code. 

Deployed at : "https://book-mark-landing-page.netlify.app/"

The reason why I decided to tackle this project was to build something modern, and clean.
I learned a lot about layouts positioning, and accessibility.
